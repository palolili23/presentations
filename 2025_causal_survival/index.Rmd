## Risk / Incidence proportion

.pull-left[
- The probability of having an incident event in a **fixed period of time**

- $Pr[Event =1]_k$ = $A/N$, where:

  + $N$ = people free of event at start of follow-up

  + $A$ = people experiencing the event
]

.pull-right[

<img src=./figs/line_graph_no_cens.png width="100%"/>

]

---
## Cumulative incidence

.pull-left[

- In the ideal scenario (no drop out)

- $Pr[T ≤ t]$, where:

  - $T$ = time to event

  - $t$ = specific time point of interest

- At baseline, cumulative incidence is 0, $Pr[T ≤ 0] = 0$

- Increases monotonically (or remains constant)
]

.pull-right[

<img src=./figs/cif.png width="100%"/>

]

---
## What makes a valid estimation of _risk_?

.pull-left[
- Target and study population clearly specified

- Defined observation period at risk

  → e.g., lifetime, 10-year, 2-week

- Complete follow-up over the observation period

- New (incident) cases only

- Starting point (baseline) is the same for all participants

]

## Examples from other fields

- **Loan default** <br><br> Risk of defaulting on a loan within the first year of the credit

- **Student dropout** <br><br> Risk of student drop out within the first 4 semesters

- **Customer churn** <br><br> Risk of subscription canceling after the 30-days free trial

--

- **Soccer** <br><br> Risk of a player scoring a goal within in the first half
 

---
## Censoring

.pull-left[

- By design, we want to prevent participant's drop out

- But in real-world data, people are loss to follow-up and drop out during the study period

- *A censoring event* makes the event of interest _unknown_ at all future time points

- Censoring is the *key* feature of time-to-event analysis

- *Time of end of study* is often defined as *administrative censoring* but I will refrain from using this jargon for now

## Incidence rates 

.pull-left[

Frequency with which incident events occur within a given amount of follow-up time.
<br> 
$A/PT$
<br>
where:
  + $A$ = Number of incident cases

  + $PT$ = "Person-time", total amount of time that all individuals were at risk of the outcome

## Hazards

.pull-left[

They are defined as the instantaneous "rate", or instantaneous probability of having the event, $Y$

<br>

**Discrete hazards**

$Pr[T = t|T > t − 1]$

$Pr [Y_k = 1|Y_{k−1} = 0]$

## Key differences between risks, rates, hazards

**Risks**
- Denominator: Number of individuals at baseline
- Numerator: Cumulative number of events over a fixed period of time

**Rates**
- Denominator: Total person-time at risk (accumulated time contributed by all individuals)
- Numerator: Number of events occurring over the total person-time

**Hazard**
- Denominator: Number of individuals at risk just before time t
- Numerator: Number of events occurrence in an small interval after time t

---
## Cox proportional hazard models

.pull-left[
In 1972, Sir David Cox introduced a novel semi-parametric regression method for "right-censored survival data"

This model allows you to include covariates

They rely on the proportional hazards assumption

Since then, the "hazard ratios" have become the _standard approach_ in observational studies looking at incident events

## From hazard to risks

- Hazard models are useful to estimate risks when censoring is present, *under certain assumptions*

- In **discrete time**, the risk at time \( k+1 \) is the probability of surviving through time \( k \), then having the event at \( k+1 \):



$$\Pr[Y_{k+1} = 1] = \left( \prod_{j=1}^{k} (1 - h_j) \right) \cdot h_{k+1}$$

Where 

$$h_j = \Pr[Y_j = 1 \mid Y_{j-1} = 0]$$

## Intervening on Censoring

.pull-left[


- Discuss that we are always implicitly asking questions about intervening on censoring

## Competing events

.pull-left[
Events that _preclude*_ the outcome of interest.

- *to prevent the existence, or occurrence of; make impossible

.pull-right[

## Competing events happen everywhere

- **Loan default**: Risk of defaulting on a loan within a given time period
  - Refinancing, paying in full

--

- **Student dropout**: Risk of student drop out within a specific number of semesters
  - Transfer to another institution

--

- **Customer churn** Risk of subscription canceling after the 30-days free trial
  - Switching to a different plan

--

- **Soccer** Risk of a player scoring a goal within in the first half
  - Receiving a red card without scoring

## Quitting smoking on dementia risk at 20 years

.center[
<img src=./figs/smoke_aje.png width="70%"/>]

???
What we see is that had we asked a question about the CDE and use appropiate methods, we would see that smoking cessation prevents dementia risk.
Had we asked a question about the total effect, smoking cessation increases your risk of dementia, but again this is not bias, but rather the unbiased result for a question that does not satisfy our interest.

## Other possible estimands

--

- **Survivors average causal effect:** 

$$Pr[Y_{t}^{a = 1} = 1 |\bar{D}_{t}^{a = 1} = \bar{D}_{t}^{a = 0} = 0] - Pr[Y_{t}^{a = 0} = 1 |\bar{D}_{t}^{a = 1} = \bar{D}_{t}^{a = 0} = 0]$$

--

- **Natural direct effects**:

$$Pr[Y_{t}^{a = 1, \bar{D}_{t}^{a = 0}} = 1] - Pr[Y_{t}^{a = 0, \bar{D}_{t}^{a = 0}} = 1]$$

$$
\hat{S}(t) = \prod_{t_i \leq t} \left( 1 - \frac{d_i}{n_i} \right)
$$

- $\hat{S}(t)$: estimated survival probability at time \( t \)
- $t_i$: the distinct times when events (e.g., deaths) occur
- $d_i$: the number of events (e.g., deaths) at time $t_i$
- $n_i$: the number of individuals at risk just before time $t_i$
