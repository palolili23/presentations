## Risk / Incidence proportion

.pull-left[
- A probability in a **fixed period of time**

- Risk = $A/N$, where:

  + $N$ = people free of outcome at start of follow-up

  + $A$ = people experiencing the outcome over a **fixed period of time**
]

.pull-right[

]

---
## Cumulative incidence

.pull-left[

- In the ideal scenario (no drop out)

- $Pr[T ≤ t]$

- At baseline, cumulative incidence is 0, $Pr[T ≤ 0] = 0$

- Increases monotonically (or remains constant)
]

.pull-right[

<img src=./figs/cif.png width="100%"/>

]

---
## What makes a valid estimation of _risk_?

.pull-left[
- Well-defined population

  → Target and study population clearly specified

- Defined observation period at risk

  → e.g., lifetime, 10-year, 2-week

- Complete follow-up over the observation period

- New (incident) cases only
]

- **Loan default** <br><br> Risk of defaulting on a loan within a given time period

- **Student dropout** <br><br> Risk of student drop out within a specific number of semesters

- **Customer churn** <br><br> Risk of subscription canceling after the 30-days free trial

- **Soccer** <br><br> Risk of a player scoring a goal within in the first half
 

---
## Censoring

.pull-left[

- In real world data, people drop out or are loss to follow-up during the study period

- This means that their outcome is _unknown_ at all time points where they were not observed

- Censoring is the key feature of time-to-event analysis

Frequency with which incident events occur within a given amount of follow-up time.

  + $PT$ = "Person-time", total amount of time that all individuals were at risk of the outcome

## Hazards

.pull-left[

They are defined as the instantaneous "rate", or instantaneous probability of having the event

$Pr[T = t|T > t − 1]$

$Pr [D_t = 1|D_{t−1} = 0]$

## Key differences between risks, rates, hazards

**Risks**
- Denominator: Number of individuals at baseline (constant).
- Numerator: Cumulative number of events from baseline to time *k*.

**Rates**
- Denominator: Total person-time at risk (accumulated time contributed by all individuals).
- Numerator: Number of events occurring over the total person-time.
- Note: Rates account for varying follow-up times and can exceed 1.

**Hazards**
- Denominator: Number of individuals at risk _just prior_ to time $k$ (varies over time).
- Numerator: Number of events occurring _in a very small interval_ around time $k$ (instantaneous rate).

---
## Cox proportional hazard models

.pull-left[
In 1972, Sir David Cox introduced a novel regression method for "right-censored survival data"

Since then, the "hazard ratios" have become the _standard approach_ in observational studies looking at incident events

They rely on the proportional hazards assumption.

.footnote[Poole. Epidemiologic Perspectives & Innovations. 2010]

---
## From hazard to risks

- Hazard models are useful to estimate risks

- Survival probability at $k$ is the product of the conditional probabilities of having survived each interval between 0 and $k$.

$$\Pr[D_k = 0] = \prod_{m=1}^{k} \Pr[D_m = 0 \mid D_{m-1} = 0]$$

---
## Causal effects

Contrast of (counterfactual) outcome distributions in the **same individuals** but under **different treatments**.

- The only explanation for a difference is the treatment, not comparing different individuals


---
## Intervening on Censoring

.pull-left[


- Discuss that we are always implicitly asking questions about intervening on censoring

]

.pull-right[

<img src=./figs/line_graph_cens.png width="100%"/>
]

- *Time of end of study* is often defined as *administrative censoring* but that adds unnecesary jargon. 
---
## Competing events

.pull-left[
Events that _preclude*_ the outcome of interest.

- *to prevent the existence, or occurrence of; make impossible
]

.pull-right[

<img src=./figs/line_graph_comp_events.png width="100%"/>

]

---
## Competing events are the norm rather than the excemption

- **Loan default**: Risk of defaulting on a loan within a given time period
  - Refinancing, paying in full
--

- **Student dropout**: Risk of student drop out within a specific number of semesters
  - Transfer to another institution

--

- **Customer churn** Risk of subscription canceling after the 30-days free trial
  - Switching to a different plan
  
--

- **Soccer** Risk of a player scoring a goal within in the first half
  - Receiving a red card without scoring

So up to now, we can see that these two questions have very different interpretations and rely on different assumptions

## Quitting smoking on dementia risk at 20 years

.center[
<img src=./figs/smoke_aje.png width="70%"/>]

???
What we see is that had we asked a question about the CDE and use appropiate methods, we would see that smoking cessation prevents dementia risk.
Had we asked a question about the total effect, smoking cessation increases your risk of dementia, but again this is not bias, but rather the unbiased result for a question that does not satisfy our interest.

## Identifiability assumptions for death

  ~ "<b> Total Effect </b>",
  ~ "<b> Controlled direct effect </b>",
  "<b> Exchangeability </b>",
  "Not needed",
  "Death is independent of future outcomes had everyone followed A = a and death was eliminated, conditional on covariates",
  "<b> Positivity </b>",
  "Not needed",
  "At every follow-up time, there are individuals with any possibly observed level A = a and covariate history who remain alive and free of dementia diagnosis.",
  "<b> Consistency </b>",
  "Not needed",
  "An intervention that “eliminates death” is well-defined."

## Other possible estimands

- **Composite outcome**

--

- **Survivors average causal effect:** 

$$Pr[Y_{t}^{a = 1} = 1 |\bar{D}_{t}^{a = 1} = \bar{D}_{t}^{a = 0} = 0] - Pr[Y_{t}^{a = 0} = 1 |\bar{D}_{t}^{a = 1} = \bar{D}_{t}^{a = 0} = 0]$$

--

- **Natural direct effects**:

$$Pr[Y_{t}^{a = 1, \bar{D}_{t}^{a = 0}} = 1] - Pr[Y_{t}^{a = 0, \bar{D}_{t}^{a = 0}} = 1]$$

---
## Separable effects

- Physical decomposition of the exposure assumed to operate on $Y$ and $D$ through separate pathways. (_Stensrud et al. JASA. 2020_)


---
## Take away points

- 

- Censoring and intercurrent events are the key feature of survival analysis

- Being explicit about how you handle them is crutial for meaninful interpretations

- Hazards and incidence rates

## Kaplan-Meier estimator

$$
\hat{S}(t) = \prod_{t_i \leq t} \left( 1 - \frac{d_i}{n_i} \right)
$$

- $\hat{S}(t)$: estimated survival probability at time \( t \)
- $t_i$: the distinct times when events (e.g., deaths) occur
- $d_i$: the number of events (e.g., deaths) at time $t_i$
- $n_i$: the number of individuals at risk just before time $t_i$
