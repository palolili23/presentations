I was born and raised in Bolivia, here in the heart of south america, where I earned my medical degree. This map, from The Lancet Global Health, shows healthcare access and quality index worlwide, and as you can see Bolivia is one of the most disadvantaged countries in the region. Experiencing these health inequities is what fueled my passion for public health.

I moved to Argentina, where I earned a Master’s in Clinical Research and completed a two-year graduate program in statistics for health sciences. Here, I mostly worked as clinical researcher in Internal Medicine, Critical Care and Liver Transplant outcomes. 
I taught biostatistics in a master program, and co-founded R-Ladies Buenos Aires, a community of practice to teach programming to women and gender minorities. After working with electronic health records and clinical registries, I realized I needed training in causal inference methods to translata data into meaningful research.

I received my PhD in Epidemiology at Erasmus MC under the mentorship of dr. sonja swanson here, my dissertation focused on extending causal inference methods to dementia research. During my PhD, I visited the CAUSALab at Harvard, and TA'd methods for confounding to master students. I also spent at the Leibniz Institute in Germany. During this time I built strong collaborations with causal inference experts and launched a career in methods. When I completed by PhD I realized I wanted to bring methods to study social determinants of health

Specifically, I focus on implementing causal inference methods to aging research
I’ve defined estimands for competing risks and truncation by death, emulated target trials, and applied g-methods.
During my postdoc I have expanded my research to study effect heterogeneity by race/ethnicity and sex/gender and applied MAIHDA framework to describe disparities.

**Modifiable Risk Factors:**
- **Clinical:** statins, blood pressure interventions

- **Social**: social isolation, education, SES, food insecurity, household crowding

What ties these factors together is that they are potentially intervenable across the life course, and this could reduce the burden and disparities in aging relevant outcomes

**Target trial framework to evaluate modifiable risk factors of dementia**

  + Intensive vs. standard management of systolic blood pressure across race/ethnic subgroups

--

**Future work**

  + Occupational determinants of cognitive and brain health in Latinx community

???
I organize my work into three main areas:

Estimands for competing and truncation events—for example, studying smoking and dementia risk, stroke and dementia risk, and social isolation and functional impairment trajectories.

Target trial frameworks—to evaluate modifiable risk factors, like intensive versus standard blood pressure management across race and ethnic subgroups.

Future work—extending these methods to study occupational determinants of cognitive and brain health in Latinx populations."*

I’ll start with the first area, estimands for competing and truncation events, to show how clarifying the research question guides the choice of methods.

# Estimands for Competing and Truncation Events

background-image: url(./figs/inverse_risk_factors.jpg)
background-size: 100%

???
Several studies had found a protective association between smoking and dementia, using data from population-based cohort studies. 
Researchers explained several biologic mechanism that could explain this association, including nicotine. 
Now your epidemiologic instincts might be thinking of all the potential sources of bias that could explain these associations...but we can only understand bias if we have a clear estimand or parameter of interest in the first place

## Quitting smoking and 20-year dementia risk  

<br><br><br>

.center[

<img src=./figs/comp_events.JPG width="60%"/>

.footnote[**C**: Shared risk factors <br> Rojas-Saunero et al. _American Journal of Epidemiology_. 2023]

???
So let's imagine a study in which people are randomized to either receive or not an intervention to help them with quitting smoking. And every year they get a dementia screenning assessment, over 20 years. So here is a node for dementia indexed at time 20. To participate in the 20th year screening people needed to survive to year 19, so here is a node for death at time 19, and the blue box represent that we are selecting those who survived. The bolded arrow represents the determinist association between these too, participants who die by time 19 have zero risk of dementia at year 20. Now smoking may directly affect dementia, but it also increases death. And there could be shared common risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes that increase the risk of dementia and death. 

So how can we summarize this challenge as part of our research question?

What we see is that had we asked a question about the CDE and use appropiate methods, we would see that smoking cessation prevents dementia risk.
Had we asked a question about the total effect, smoking cessation increases your risk of dementia, but again this is not bias, but rather the unbiased result for a question that does not satisfy our interest.

# Discussion

- Competing events can be framed in different ways depending on the research question

--

- All approaches have trade-offs—there is no "one size fits all"

--

- Measures of disparity are shaped by differential mortality

--

- Translating novel estimands into applied research requires acknowledging their importance first

--

- Progress needs collaboration across statisticians, epidemiologists, applied researchers, and stakeholders

# Discussion

- The target trial framework makes explicit the assumptions needed to estimate causal effects from observational data

--

- Intensive blood pressure control appeared beneficial for Black, Latinx and White participants; while results for Chinese adults suggested possible harm, highlighting heterogeneity

--

- Findings suggest that Black and Latinx adults may require greater support to sustain intensive control

--

- Target trial emulation allows us to move from associations to quantifying the potential effect of implementable and equitable interventions

## Occupational Determinants of Cognitive and Brain Health Among Middle-Aged and Older Latinxs

**Early life to midlife:** Do physical & mental job stressors shape cognitive function in Latina women from agricultural areas? (CHAMACOS)

--

**Mid- and Late Life:** How do job stressors & occupational complexity relate to neuroimaging biomarkers? (SOL-INCA)

--

**Hypothetical stochastic interventions:** What much would cognitive decline change had we reduced job stressors and/or increased occupational complexity? Who benefits most? (SOL-INCA)

## Quantitative bias analysis for differential dementia diagnosis

.left-column[

We set the sensitivity of dementia diagnosis in the stroke group to 0.99 and considered a range (0.5 - 0.9) of sensitivity values in the no-stroke group
