I was born and raised in Bolivia, here in the heart of south america, where I earned my medical degree. This map, from The Lancet Global Health, shows healthcare access and quality index worlwide, and as you can see Bolivia is one of the most disadvantaged countries in the region. Experiencing these health inequities during my training fueled my passion for public health.

I moved to Argentia, where I earned a Master’s in Clinical Research and completed a two-year graduate program in statistics for health sciences. During that time I worked predominantly in clinical research in Internal Medicine, Critical Care and Liver Transplant outcomes. 
I taught biostatistics in a master program, and founded R-Ladies Buenos Aires, a chapter to teach programing to women and gender minorities. After working with electronic health records and clinical registries, I knew I needed to train in causal inference methods to translata data into meaningful research.

I received my PhD in Epidemiology at Erasmus MC in Rotterdam Netherlands, my work was to extend causal inference methods in dementia research. During my PhD, I visited the CAUSALab at Harvard, TA’d an online course on Confounding by Dr. Miguel Hernán. I also spent at the Leibniz Institute in Germany. While I built strong collaborations with causal inference experts and launched a career in methods, I realized that I had drifted from my passion to understand health inequities, and I seeked a postdoc to learn about the field of social epi.

???
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias pose a global public health challenge, disproportionately affecting women and underserved populations, particularly in LMICs. Despite the growing burden, their causes remain poorly understood, and effective therapies are lacking. This has fueled a strong interest in identifying modifiable risk factors for dementia prevention.

???
Researchers have often found unexpected inverse associations between common risk factors—such as smoking, hypertension, and obesity—and dementia. An even more striking example is the well-documented inverse association between cancer and dementia.

Your epidemiologic instincts might point to survival bias, but in this talk, I'll illustrate that bias isn’t always bias—it can be the unbiased answer to the wrong estimand.
With that in mind, let's jump to my work on...

# A. Advances on estimands for research questions with competing events

## Competing events


Events that _preclude*_ the outcome of interest.

- *to prevent the existence, or occurrence of; make impossible

--

.center[

<img src=./figs/data_structure.png width="60%"/>

]

???
Competing events prevent the outcome of interest from occurring. For example, if dementia diagnosis is the outcome, a person who dies from heart disease can no longer develop dementia. This means deaths remove individuals from the population "at risk" for dementia.

---
## The hazard of hazard ratios

.pull-left[
.center[
<img src=./figs/hr_hypertension.png />
]
]


???
A major issue with time-to-event analyses is the widespread use of Cox models and hazard ratios. Hazards inherently suffer from selection bias because they represent the instantaneous probability of the outcome, conditional on survival. If a large proportion of individuals die early, the analysis is increasingly restricted to a healthier subset over time.

For example, many studies report that hypertension in older age appears to reduce dementia risk, with hazard ratios below 1. In a collaboration I’m involved in, we replicated this pattern—observing HRs shifting toward the null at older ages.

However, when examining absolute differences in cumulative dementia incidence by hypertension status, a different picture emerges: individuals with hypertension have a higher cumulative incidence of dementia over time, with disparities widening significantly at older ages.

This reflects that there is lack of communication between and a lack of teaching resources on this area.

Stroke can precipitate pathological changes in the neurovascular unitleading to loss of structural and functional connectivity that could increase dementia risk.
Previous work had major methodological limitations, including how to account for the fact that stroke increases mortality, which competes with dementia.
Studies on this topic have very selected samples with minimal (if any)representation of the Asian American population.

However, if we would have targeted a total effect, including the indirect path that stroke increases mortality, all effects shift towards or below the null. This reiterates how different ways to account for death as a competing event can lead to very different results. 

Now on all analysis, we are assuming that there is no measurement error, but we can expect that those who have had a stroke had a strick screening of cognitive impairment. And  among those who don't have stroke, their is potential underdiagnosis of dementia. To understand how this bias could impact our results we did a QBA.

### Quantitative bias analysis for differential dementia diagnosis

We set the sensitivity of dementia diagnosis in the stroke arm to 0.99 and considered a range of sensitivity values in the no-stroke arm, from 0.50 (worst case scenario) to 0.90.

???
As we observed in the paper in MESA, under the same intervention we would need to intervene on more Latinx and Black particulants, as they have a larger burden of disease. 
As opossed to an randomized trial where the interventions are assigned randomly to create balanced groups, effect heterogeneity in observational studies can arise from multiple sources, such as a differential frequency of the exposure, difference in outcome and in competing events. Different groups may have a different confounding structure.
