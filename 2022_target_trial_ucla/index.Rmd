## Brief overview of some causal inference concepts

---

### Counterfactuals

Involves the human tendency to create possible alternatives to life events that have already occurred; something that is contrary to what actually happened. (_wiki_)

**Counterfactual outcomes**: to emphasize that these outcomes represent situations that may not actually occur (that is, counterto-the-fact situations).


**Potential outcomes**: to emphasize that, depending on the treatment that is received, different outcomes can be potentially observed.

---

### Notation

- A = 1 if I ate &#x1F36B; 

- A = 0 if I did not eat &#x274C;&#x1F36B;

- Y = 1 if I passed the test

- Y = 0 si I failed the test


- $Y^a$ is the counterfactual outcome under the level of A = a

---

### Individual causal effect

If I had eaten &#x1F36B;, I would have passed the test.

$Y^{a=1} = 1$

$Y^{a=0} = 0$

### The fundamental problem of causal inference

<br><br>

```{r}
tab <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Person, ~`A`, ~`Y`, ~`Ya=1`, ~`Ya=0`,
  "Ann",        "1",     "1",           "1",           "?",
  "Jhon",     "0",     "0",           "?",           "0",
  "Camila",    "1",     "1",           "1",           "?",
  "Ming",     "0",     "0",           "?",           "0",
  "Jesse",    "0",     "1",           "?",           "1"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(Effect = "?") 
tab %>%
  kableExtra::kable()
```

<br>

**Average causal effect:** $Pr[Y^{a=1} = 1] \neq Pr[Y^{a=0} = 1]$

---
### Randomized trials

Experiment in which participants are randomly assigned to follow specified treatment strategies.

--

**Ideal randomized trial**:

   + No loss to follow-up

   + Full adherence throught the study duration

   + Double blind assignment

--

Usually they following time points are aligned by design:

- Eligibility criteria

- Treatment assignment (randomization)

- Follow-up starts

???
Counterfactual or potential outcomes, Causal diagrams (e.g., DAGs, SWIGs)
The concept of an “ideal randomized trial” is tied directly to these languages

**Association is causation!**

]

.footnote[**Hernán MA, Robins JM (2020). Causal Inference: What If**]

???
Under this design, comparing the observed average outcomes under each treatment arm is the same as comparing what would have happened had everybody been in one treatment arm versus the other

---
## Target trial

--

- Conceptualize the hypothetical randomized trial we would like to conduct that answers our question

--

- Describe the protocol elements of that target trial

--

- Emulate the target trial with observational data as close as possible

--

- Benefits of protocol specification:

  + Helps with refining the research question (AKA estimand)
  
  + Helps detect sources of bias that can be prevented by design or in the analysis, or quantified
  
  + Explicit and transparent assumptions to connect our observed data to the causal question

  + Ensures clearer interpretations of results

### Statins and the risk of dementia

.footnote[Edouard L. Fu et al. Clinical Kidney Journal. 2020]
???

Frequently, observational studies that don't conceptualize the target trial selfinflict with bias due to time-zero missalignment, or other sources of bias

### Current work

- Can we reduce the disparities in the risk of dementia across race/ethnicity groups, by reducing the disparities in hypertension?

- Extend the work on hypothetical interventions to reduce blood pressure sustainly over time across race/ethnicity.

- Data sources: Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)


---

### A note on well-defined interventions

<br><br>

- There is a long standing debate on what classifies as "well-defined" or "ill-defined".

--

- We didn't specified how SBP would be lowered, this represents a weighted average of strategies, determined by the frequency of these in the studied population.

--

- The target trial framework helps us in being more transparent about our questions, assumptions and interpretations.

---

## Take aways


- Having a clear question (or estimand) is key to conceptualize the best study design that answers it. 

--

- We can use the target trial framework even if we don’t have the intervention of
interested measured (or discovered).

--

- Specifying the components of the target trial should be one of the first steps prior to the outline
of an analysis plan that emulates such trial. 

--

- We can prevent several sources of bias from having a better design, and we can identify other sources of bias that can prevented (or quantified) through the analytic strategies.

--

- It is a dynamic process, since it requires a deep understanding of the data sources and a constant check that the causal contrasts and subsequent results are informative.
