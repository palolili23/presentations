# Types of research questions

- **Descriptive:**

  + What is the lifetime risk of dementia for women and men born in 1940 in Los Angeles
  
--

- **Predictive:**

  + Is subjective cognitive impairment at age 60 a good diagnostic predictor of cognitive impairment at age 70?
  
--

- **Causal (etiologic, interventional)**

  + What is the effect of persistent daily interpersonal racial discrimination in midlife in dementia risk over 10 years of follow-up?
  
  + What is the effect of Lecanemab in amyloid deposition over 18 months of treatment?

# Estimands


.pull-left[
<br><br>

**Definition**: The specific quantity you want to estimate, that answers your research question.

# Estimands have 5 elements

**1. Target population** 

--

**2. Exposure, treatment, comparison groups**

--

**3. Outcome (endpoint)**: within a time frame

--

**4. Summary measure:** A population-level measure of frequency that is _interpretable_
  + $Pr(Y_t=1|A=1) - Pr(Y_t=1|A=0)$
  + $E(Y_t|A=1) - E(Y_t|A=0)$

**5. Intercurrent events:** Events that will prevent us from observing the exposure or outcome
  + E.g. adverse reactions, death, loss to follow-up

# Ideal study


- Target and study population clearly specified

- Defined observation period at risk

  → e.g., lifetime, 10-year, 2-weeks

- Complete follow-up over the observation period

- Starting point (baseline) is the same for all participants

---
## Censoring

.pull-left[

- By design, we want to prevent participant's dropout

- But in real-world data, people are loss to follow-up and drop out during the study period

- *A censoring event* makes the event of interest _unknown_ at all future time points

- Censoring is the *key* feature of time-to-event analysis

]


.pull-right[

<img src=./figs/line_graph_cens.png width="100%"/>

]

- *Time of end of study* is often defined as *administrative censoring* but I will refrain from using this jargon for now

---
## Implications of censoring

.pull-left[

- Statistical literature

  - Censoring events are independent of the event of interest
  
  - Censoring events are uninformative
  
- Causal literature

  - Counterfactual scenario where censoring events were eliminated
  
  - $Pr[Y_{k+1}] = Pr[Y^{\overline{\text{LTFU}} = 0}_{k+1}]$
  
  -  $Pr[Y^{a = 1, \overline{\text{LTFU}} = 0}_{k+1}]$ - $Pr[Y^{a = 0, \overline{\text{LTFU}} = 0}_{k+1}]$

# Intercurrent event of death

- Let's say we are interested in measuring the outcome **Y** at 1 year of follow-up

- A participant dies at 6 months of follow-up

  - If Y is binary, e.g. **dementia diagnosis**, then the probability of **Y** at 1 year is **0** 
  
    → Death is a _competing event_
  
  - If Y is continuous, such as **cognitive function**, then the expected value of **Y** at 1 year is **undefined (maybe not of substantive interest)**

    → Death is a _truncation event_

## Mean differences in functional impairment by social isolation status

---
## What about causal effects?

<br><br>

- Contrast of (counterfactual) outcome distributions in the **same individuals** but under **different treatments**.

- The only explanation for a difference is the intervention, not comparing different individuals (including over time)

- Therefore, the **as observed** estimand is not causal
