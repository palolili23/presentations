## Motivation

- Stroke can precipitate pathological changes in the neurovascular unit leading to loss of structural and functional connectivity that could increase dementia risk.

--

- Studies on this topic have very selected samples with minimal (if any) representation of the Asian American population.

--

- Previous work had major methodological limitations, including how to account for the fact that stroke increases mortality, which competes with dementia.

---
## Research question

- What is the effect of incident stroke in the 10-year-risk of dementia across different Asian American ethnicities and White populations, <ins>if we could remove the effect of stroke on death</ins>?

- What is the <ins>total effect</ins> of incident stroke in the 10-year-risk of dementia  across different Asian American ethnicities and White populations?

---
## Study population

- **Study sample:**

 + Kaiser Permanente Northern California members who participated on the California Men’s Health Study (CMHS) or the Kaiser Permanente Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health Survey (RPGEH) who self-identified as Asian Americans or White.

--

- **Eligibility criteria:**

 + With no history of stroke
 + With no history of dementia
 + From 60 to 89 years old

---
## Study Design

- **Exposure:** Incident stroke (ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke)

- **Outcome:** Incident dementia diagnosis (Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, and non-specific dementia diagnosis)

- **Time zero/Baseline:** Time of survey

- **End of follow-up:** Time of dementia diagnosis, time of death prior to dementia diagnosis, turning 90 years old

---
## Covariates

.pull-left[

**Time-fixed covariates**

- Age at survey
- Sex/gender
- Nativity status
- Educational attainment
- Health status
- Smoking status

]

--

.pull-right[

**Time-varying covariates**

- Systolic blood pressure (median value/year)
- BMI (median value/year)
- Cholesterol (median value/year)
- Incident diabetes
- Incident hypertension
- Incident myocardial infarction
- Incident congestive heart failure
- Incident cancer

]

---
## Statistical Analysis

**Weights calculation**

- **Inverse probability weights for stroke (IPTW):** so that those who have a stroke and those who don't are comparable at every time-point before stroke.

--

- **Inverse probability weights for death over follow-up (IPCW):** to make participants who remain alive after stroke comparable to the no-stroke group over follow-up.

---

## Statistical Analysis

**Direct effect:** Plug IPTW x IPCW in a Kaplan-Meier estimator.

--

**Total effect:** Plug IPTW in an Aalen-Johannsen estimator.

--

**Effect estimation:** Calculate cumulative incidence of dementia and risk ratio at 10 years of follow-up. Bootstrap confidence intervals.

### Effect of stroke on the risk of dementia on the relative scale

---
## Discussion

- The incidence of stroke is high across all Asian American ethnicities and in the White population.

--

- Ischemic stroke was more frequently observed, compared to hemorrhagic stroke.

--

- There is a large effect of stroke on the risk of dementia if we remove the effect that stroke has on death (_as if we could have prevented it_) and this is consistent across groups.
