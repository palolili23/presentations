## Correlation is not causation

???
In this example we see that Ice cream sales increase when people get sunburned.

These two things are correlated: meaning that they happen together, but one doesn't necessarily cause the other.

## Correlation is not causation

???
There could be another factor, such as as high temperature in a summer day that both causes people to buy icecream, and it causes sunburn!

In public health, many times we are interested in asking causal questions, we want to know if changing a behavior, changing diet, or even changing complex things such as discrimination and social and economic burden (a.k.a) weathering, can have an impact in our health. 

---
##  Counterfactual/Causal thinking

???
To answer these questions, we use counterfactual or causal thinking. Yes, the word "counterfactual" sounds very complicated, but I promise you, you are experts in using this approach in daily life. For example...


- If I had studied last night, would I have gotten a higher test score?

--

- If I hadnâ€™t walked barefoot, I would have avoided catching a cold.

--

- If they hadn't changed the goalkeeper, they would have won the penalty round.

--

- If you had taken Sunset Blvd. instead of Santa Monica Blvd., would you have arrived on time?


---
### Exercise: Construct a counterfactual statement

- Think of a recent event where something did not go as planned.

--

- Imagine an alternative version of the past where you changed one specific factor.

--

- Write a counterfactual statement using this structure:

.center[
"If [_X had done something differently_], <br> <br> then [_a different outcome might have happened_]."
]

```{r}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 1, seconds = 0, bottom = 0)
```

---
## Pair Discussion

- Share your statement with your classmate sitting to your right.

- Discuss: 

  + What assumption are you making about causality?

  + Are there other factors that might have influenced the outcome?

  + How confident are you in your counterfactual scenario?


```{r}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 0, bottom = 0)
```

## Counterfactual Thinking

<br<br><br>
.center[
.bigger[
Counterfactual thinking involves imagining an alternative version of the past and considering how the outcome might have changed. It helps us think about "**_what could have been_**"]]

???
To formalize a bit, counterfactual thinking... and this is the set

---
## Causal Reasoning

<br><br>

.center[
.bigger[
Causal reasoning involves understanding how a _change_ in one factor (**"the cause"**) 


leads to a change in another factor (**"the effect"**).

## Let's go for icecream, it will make you feel happy...

???
Now that you know you are experts in counterfactual thinking, we are going to translate the language of counterfactuals to mathematical notations.

I know that math can be intimidating, believe me I always did, but I want you to take this opportunity to see math as a universal language, a language that can help community across people all over the world.

## Notation

.pull-left[
**Observed world (The Factual) **

- A = 0 if did not eat &#x274C;&#x1F366;

- A = 1 if ate &#x1F366;

- Y = 1 if &#x1F60A;

- Y = 0 if &#x1F614;

]

--
.pull-right[
**Counterfactual worlds** 
- Y<sup>a=1</sup>: the counterfactual outcome (&#x1F60A; or &#x1F614;) had a = &#x1F366;

- Y<sup>a=0</sup>: the counterfactual outcome (&#x1F60A; or &#x1F614;) had a = &#x274C;&#x1F366;

### Fundamental problem of causal inference 

In real life, we only observe **one** of the counterfactual scenarios

.pull-left[
```{r}
tab <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Person, ~`A`, ~`Y`, ~`Y<sup>a=1</sup>`, ~`Y<sup>a=0</sup>`,
  "Anita",   "1",     "1",           "1",           "?",
  "James",    "0",     "0",            "?",           "0",
  "Min",    "1",     "1",         "1",     "?",  
  "Jackson",   "0",     "0",        "?",     "0",  
  "Jesse",     "0",     "1",           "?",     "1",  
  "Maria", "1",     "1",           "1",        "?") 
tab %>% 
  mutate(Effect = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  kableExtra::kable()
```
]

--
.pull-right[

With a binary exposure, one counterfactual outcome is **observable** and one is **missing**. Thus, we can't estimate **individual causal effect** directly. It's a missing data issue.
