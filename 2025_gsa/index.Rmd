“In aging research, especially when studying outcomes like memory decline, death is not just a nuisance—it's a fundamental part of the data-generating process. If we ignore it, we risk answering the wrong question. This talk is about how we define causal questions—or estimands—in the presence of death, and why getting those questions right is essential for interpreting results that inform science, care, and policy.”

# Estimand

.center[<img src=./figs/estimands_meme_horizontal.jpg width="120%"/>]

.center[.bigger[Specific quantity that we want to estimate that answers our research question.]]

# Causal estimands have 5 elements

1. Target population

2. Exposure/treatment arms

3. Outcome defined within a time frame

4. Interpretable effect measure (e.g. mean difference, risk difference, risk ratio)

5. **Intercurrent events:** Events that will prevent us from observing the outcome (e.g. adverse reactions, death, loss to follow-up)

# How can we incorporate death as part of incident dementia analysis?

## Quitting smoking and 20-year dementia risk  

<br><br><br>

.center[

???
So let's imagine a study in which people are randomized to either receive or not an intervention to help them with quitting smoking. And every year they get a dementia screenning assessment, over 20 years. So here is a node for dementia indexed at time 20. To participate in the 20th year screening people needed to survive to year 19, so here is a node for death at time 19, and the blue box represent that we are selecting those who survived. The bolded arrow represents the determinist association between these too, participants who die by time 19 have zero risk of dementia at year 20. Now smoking may directly affect dementia, but it also increases death. And there could be shared common risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes that increase the risk of dementia and death.

## Total effect

.center[

What is the risk** of dementia at 20 years of follow-up had all individuals stopped smoking, compared to had all individuals continued smoking?

$$Pr[Y_{20}^{a = 1} = 1] - Pr[Y_{20}^{a = 0} = 1]$$

<img src=./figs/total_effect.JPG width="60%"/>

]]

** _Cause-specific cumulative incidence_ or _crude_ risk

## Controlled direct effect

.center[
.middle[

What is the risk** of dementia at 20 years of follow-up had all individuals stopped smoking _and not died_ during the study period, compared to had all individuals continued smoking _and not died_ ?

$$Pr[Y_{20}^{a = 1, d_{19} = 0} = 1] - Pr[Y_{20}^{a = 0, d_{19} = 0} = 1]$$

<img src=./figs/direct_effect.JPG width="60%"/>

** _Marginal_ or _net_ risk

So up to now, we can see that these two questions have very different interpretations and rely on different assumptions

.footnote[Rojas-Saunero et al. _American Journal of Epidemiology_. 2023]

???
What we see is that had we asked a question about the CDE and use appropiate methods, we would see that smoking cessation prevents dementia risk.
Had we asked a question about the total effect, smoking cessation increases your risk of dementia, but again this is not bias, but rather the unbiased result for a question that does not satisfy our interest.

## Take aways

.bigger[
- Different questions (_estimands_) can lead to different (even opposite) results, with very different interprations, and no "one size fits all"]

--
.bigger[
- We can only understand bias relative to an specific estimand, as the all rely in different assumptions

.bigger[
- Progress needs collaboration across statisticians, epidemiologists, applied researchers, and stakeholders

# Other estimands

- Survival Average Causal Effect

$E[Y_t^{a=1}|D_t^{a=1} = D_t^{a=0} = 0] - E[Y_t^{a=0}|D_t^{a=1} = D_t^{a=0} = 0]$

- Composite Outcome

$E[Y_{t}^{a = 1}  \text{ or } {Y|D}_{t}^{a = 1} = x] - E[Y_{t}^{a = 0} \text{ or } {Y|D}_{t}^{a = 0} = x]$, where $x$ is a value for memory function after death
