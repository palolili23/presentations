## Systematic review

**Searching criteria**

- Original research published between Jan/2018 to Dec/2019

- Dementia/AD & longitudinal/cohort & hazard/risk 

- Alzheimer’s and Dementia, Annals of Neurology, BMJ, Neurology, JAMA, Jama Neurology, Lancet, Lancet Neurology
  
--

**Eligibility criteria** 

- Time-to-dementia/AD as primary or co-primary outcome

- With a clear exposure/intervention, and uses methods to handle confounding

- Not a descriptive or predictive aim

---

## Results

Out of **57/209** papers included:

--

- **56%** report death numbers, **18%** death by exposure level

--

- **47%** do not include any description about death in the methods section, **26%** consider it a sensitivity example, **14%** only mention it was treated as a censoring event

--

- **87%** use Cox PH models, **93%** present hazard ratios

--

- **86%** innacurate interpretations (e.g. "_risks_")

  "Not needed",
  "An intervention that “eliminates death (competing events)” is well-defined."
)

---
## Application 

- Participants from Rotterdam Study I, recruited between 1990-1993 and with follow-up data 

  - Current and former smokers

  - No prior history of dementia diagnosis

  - Complete information at baseline

- Final sample size of 4179 participants

- Mean age at baseline of 62 years

- 368 developed dementia and 1318 died

---
## Analysis plan

- **For confounding:** Inverse probability weighting for treatment (IPTW)

--

- **Total effect:** Cause-specific cumulative incidence / Aalen-Johansen estimator + IPTW

--

- **Controlled direct effect:** Kaplan-Meier + Inverse probability censoring weights + IPTW

--

- Bootstrapping for confidence intervals

Semi-parametric or parametric alternatives are also possible

## Other examples


---
## Other possible estimands

- **Survivors average causal effect:** The risk of dementia on a subgroup of individuals who would never experience the competing event.

--

- **Separable effects:** Effects of modified treatments motivated by
the physical decomposition of the exposure assumed to operate on dementia and death through separate pathways.

--

- **Composite outcome of dementia and death**

## Conclusion

- When competing events are present there is more than one way to consider them as part of the primary research question.

--

- Let the question guide the most appropiate methods and estimators.

--

- For various reasons, risks and survival curves should be preferred over hazards.

--

- Collaborative work between clinical researchers, epidemiologists and statisticians should narrow the gap between methods development and applied research.
