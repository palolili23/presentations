## Causal effect

Contrast of (counterfactual) outcome distributions in the **same individuals** but under **different treatments**.

- The only explanation for a difference is the treatment, not comparing different individuals

## Application 

- Participants from Rotterdam Study I, recruited between 1990-1993 and with follow-up data 

  - Current and former smokers

  - No prior history of dementia diagnosis

  - Complete information at baseline

- Final sample size of 4179 participants

- Mean age at baseline of 62 years

- 368 developed dementia and 1318 died

---
## Analysis plan

- **For confounding:** Inverse probability weighting for treatment (IPTW)

--

- **Total effect:** Cause-specific cumulative incidence / Aalen-Johansen estimator + IPTW

--

- **Controlled direct effect:** Kaplan-Meier + Inverse probability censoring weights + IPTW

--

- Bootstrapping for confidence intervals

Semi-parametric or parametric alternatives are also possible

## History of competing events analysis

## History of competing events analysis

- During the smallpox epidemic (18th century), smallpox inoculation was a controversial therapy.

--

- Bernoulli compared the observed life expectancy to a counterfactual scenario where inoculation was mandatory for everyone at birth (thus eliminating smallpox deaths).

--

- He concluded that this would increase life expectancy at that time.

--

- Counterfactual scenarios to study life-expectancy had tuberculosis & cancer deaths had been prevented became popularized.

.footnote[Karn. Annals of Eugenics. 1931; Colombo & Diamanti. Lettera Matematica. 2015]
---
## Other possible estimands

- **Composite outcome of dementia and death**

- **Survivors average causal effect:** 

$$Pr[Y_{t}^{a = 1} = 1 |\bar{D}_{t}^{a = 1} = \bar{D}_{t}^{a = 0} = 0] - Pr[Y_{t}^{a = 0} = 1 |\bar{D}_{t}^{a = 1} = \bar{D}_{t}^{a = 0} = 0]$$

- **Natural direct effects**:

$$Pr[Y_{t}^{a = 1, \bar{D}_{t}^{a = 0}} = 1] - Pr[Y_{t}^{a = 0, \bar{D}_{t}^{a = 0}} = 1]$$
???
The SACE would refer to a subset of the original population who would never experience the competing event regardless of the intervention

---

## Separable effects

Effects of modified treatments motivated by the physical decomposition of the exposure assumed to operate on dementia and death through separate pathways.

## Conclusion

- When competing events are present there is more than one way to consider them as part of the primary research question.

--

- Let the question guide the most appropiate methods and estimators.

--

- We need to communicate that all these questions are possible (with their trade-offs),rather than prescribing analytical recipes to fit generic (and empty) classifications such as“etiological” or “predictive”. 

--

- Collaborative work between clinical researchers, epidemiologists and statisticians should narrow the gap between methods development and applied research.
