# Research Focus

So across methods, risk factors, and outcomes, my research aims to identify actionable targets to reduce the burden of aging related outcomes, and related disparties, as well as to develope and teach methods to improve the quality of AD/ADRD research.

# Research Outline

**Estimands for competing and truncation events on aging-related outcomes**

  + Smoking and dementia risk
  + Stroke and dementia risk
  + Social isolation and functional impairment trajectories

**Target trial framework to evaluate modifiable risk factors of dementia**

  + Intensive vs. standard management of systolic blood pressure across race/ethnic subgroups

???
I organize my work into three main areas:

Estimands for competing and truncation events—for example, studying smoking and dementia risk, stroke and dementia risk, and social isolation and functional impairment trajectories.

Target trial frameworks—to evaluate modifiable risk factors, like intensive versus standard blood pressure management across race and ethnic subgroups.

Future work—extending these methods to study occupational determinants of cognitive and brain health in Latinx populations."*

I’ll start with the first area, estimands for competing and truncation events, to show how clarifying the research question guides the choice of methods.

# Estimands for Competing and Truncation Events

???
Several studies had found a protective association between smoking and dementia, using data from population-based cohort studies. 
Researchers explained several biologic mechanism that could explain this association, including nicotine. 
Now your epidemiologic instincts might be thinking of all the potential sources of bias that could explain these associations...but we can only understand bias if we have a clear estimand or parameter of interest in the first place

## Quitting smoking and 20-year dementia risk  

<br><br><br>

.center[

<img src=./figs/comp_events.JPG width="60%"/>

.footnote[**C**: Shared risk factors <br> Rojas-Saunero et al. _American Journal of Epidemiology_. 2023]

???
So let's imagine a study in which people are randomized to either receive or not an intervention to help them with quitting smoking. And every year they get a dementia screenning assessment, over 20 years. So here is a node for dementia indexed at time 20. To participate in the 20th year screening people needed to survive to year 19, so here is a node for death at time 19, and the blue box represent that we are selecting those who survived. The bolded arrow represents the determinist association between these too, participants who die by time 19 have zero risk of dementia at year 20. Now smoking may directly affect dementia, but it also increases death. And there could be shared common risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes that increase the risk of dementia and death. 

So how can we summarize this challenge as part of our research question?

What we see is that had we asked a question about the CDE and use appropiate methods, we would see that smoking cessation prevents dementia risk.
Had we asked a question about the total effect, smoking cessation increases your risk of dementia, but again this is not bias, but rather the unbiased result for a question that does not satisfy our interest.

**Functional Impairment**: Functional impairment (ADLs + IADLs + mobility, 0–36) at 4 waves over 5 years

**Descriptive estimands**:

**As observed:** among participants still alive and observed

**Under elimination of dropout/death:** predicts trajectories for all participants at all waves

# Discussion

- Competing events can be framed in different ways depending on the research question

--

- All approaches have trade-offs—there is no "one size fits all"

--

- Translating novel estimands into applied research requires acknowledging their importance first

--

- Progress needs collaboration across statisticians, epidemiologists, applied researchers, and stakeholders

## Hypertension and Blood Pressure

- SPRINT-MIND: intensive (<120 mmHg) vs. standard (<140 mmHg) control of systolic blood pressure on dementia outcomes

- Highly selected population → limited generalizability

- Hypertension burden is higher in Black and Latinx adults

- We need evidence on whether intensive blood pressure control could reduce disparities

# Discussion

- Intensive blood pressure control appeared beneficial for Black, Latinx and White participants; while results for Chinese adults suggested possible harm, highlighting heterogeneity

--

- Findings suggest that Black and Latinx adults may require greater support to sustain intensive control

--

- The target trial framework helps us refine research questions to estimate the impact of potentially implementable and equitable interventions

--

- It promotes transparency on the assumptions needed to estimate causal effects from observational data
