# Estimands for Competing and Truncation Events

background-image: url(./figs/inverse_risk_factors.jpg)
background-size: 100%

???
Several studies had found a protective association between smoking and dementia, using data from population-based cohort studies. 
Researchers explained several biologic mechanism that could explain this association, including nicotine. 
Now your epidemiologic instincts might be thinking of all the potential sources of bias that could explain these associations...but we can only understand bias if we have a clear estimand or parameter of interest in the first place

## Quitting smoking and 20-year dementia risk

???
So let's imagine a study in which people are randomized to either receive or not an intervention to help them with quitting smoking. And every year they get a dementia screenning assessment, over 20 years. So here is a node for dementia indexed at time 20. To participate in the 20th year screening people needed to survive to year 19, so here is a node for death at time 19, and the blue box represent that we are selecting those who survived. The bolded arrow represents the determinist association between these too, participants who die by time 19 have zero risk of dementia at year 20. Now smoking may directly affect dementia, but it also increases death. And there could be shared common risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes that increase the risk of dementia and death.

# Estimand

.center[<img src=./figs/estimands_meme_horizontal.jpg width="120%"/>]

.center[.bigger[Specific quantity that we want to estimate that answers our research question (_parameter of interest_).]]

---
# Causal estimands have 5 elements

1. Target population: Older adults who smoke, with no cardiovascular or lung comorbidities

--

2. Exposure/Treatment arms ($A$): Smoking cessation program vs. no intervention

--

3. Outcome ($Y$): Dementia diagnosis over 20 years

--

4. Summary measure: A population-level measure of frequency that is _interpretable_ (e.g. risk difference: $Pr[Y_{20}^{a = 1} = 1] - Pr[Y_{20}^{a = 0} = 1]$)

--

5. Intercurrent events: Events that prevent us from observing the exposure or outcome (e.g. death, loss to follow-up)

---

## Total effect

What is the risk** of dementia at 20 years of follow-up had all individuals stopped smoking, compared to had all individuals continued smoking?

$$Pr[Y_{20}^{a = 1} = 1] - Pr[Y_{20}^{a = 0} = 1]$$

** _Cause-specific cumulative incidence_ or _crude_ risk

## Controlled direct effect

So up to now, we can see that these two questions have very different interpretations and rely on different assumptions

What we see is that had we asked a question about the CDE and use appropiate methods, we would see that smoking cessation prevents dementia risk.
Had we asked a question about the total effect, smoking cessation increases your risk of dementia, but again this is not bias, but rather the unbiased result for a question that does not satisfy our interest.

- The evidence between social isolation and functional impairment is mixed

- Most studies have an analytic sample of only survivors

## Methods

**Social Isolation**: Binarized 5-item Social Isolation Index

**Functional Impairment**: Functional impairment (ADLs + IADLs + mobility, 0–36) at 4 waves over 5 years

**As observed estimand:** among participants still alive and observed
$E(Y_t|SI=1, Death_t = 0)$ & $E(Y_t|SI=0, Death_t = 0)$

**Under elimination of dropout/death estimand** predicts trajectories for all participants at all waves
$E[Y_t^{\overline{\text{Death}} = 0}|SI=1]$ & $E[Y_t^{\overline{\text{Death}} = 0}|SI=0]$

# Discussion

- Competing events can be framed in different ways depending on the research question

--

- All approaches have trade-offs—there is no "one size fits all"

--

- Translating novel estimands into applied research requires acknowledging their importance first

--

- Progress needs collaboration across statisticians, epidemiologists, applied researchers, and stakeholders

## Hypertension and Blood Pressure

- SPRINT-MIND: intensive (<120 mmHg) vs. standard (<140 mmHg) control of systolic blood pressure on dementia outcomes

- Highly selected population → limited generalizability

- Hypertension burden is higher in Black and Latinx adults

- We need evidence on whether intensive blood pressure control could reduce disparities

# Discussion

- Intensive blood pressure control appeared beneficial for Black, Latinx and White participants; while results for Chinese adults suggested possible harm, highlighting heterogeneity

--

- Findings suggest that Black and Latinx adults may require greater support to sustain intensive control

--

- The target trial framework helps us refine research questions (i.e. estimands) to estimate the impact of potentially implementable and equitable interventions

--

- It promotes transparency on the assumptions needed to estimate causal effects from observational data
