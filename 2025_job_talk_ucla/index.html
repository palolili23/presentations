I was born and raised in Bolivia, here in the heart of south america, where I earned my medical degree. This map, from The Lancet Global Health, shows healthcare access and quality index worlwide, and as you can see Bolivia is one of the most disadvantaged countries in the region. Experiencing these health inequities during my training fueled my passion for public health.

I moved to Argentia, where I earned a Master’s in Clinical Research and completed a two-year graduate program in statistics for health sciences. During that time I worked predominantly in clinical research in Internal Medicine, Critical Care and Liver Transplant outcomes. 
I taught biostatistics in a master program, and founded R-Ladies Buenos Aires, a chapter to teach programing to women and gender minorities. After working with electronic health records and clinical registries, I knew I needed to train in causal inference methods to translata data into meaningful research.

I received my PhD in Epidemiology at Erasmus MC in Rotterdam Netherlands, my work was to extend causal inference methods in dementia research. During my PhD, I visited the CAUSALab at Harvard, TA’d an online course on Confounding by Dr. Miguel Hernán. I also spent at the Leibniz Institute in Germany. While I built strong collaborations with causal inference experts and launched a career in methods, I realized that I had drifted from my passion to understand health inequities, and I seeked a postdoc to learn about the field of social epi.

More generally, researchers have often found unexpected inverse associations between common risk factors—such as smoking, hypertension, and obesity—and dementia. An even more striking example is the well-documented inverse association between cancer and dementia.

Your epidemiologic instincts might be thinking of all the potential sources of bias that could explain these associations, while researchers are thinking of all the potential biological mechanisms that could explain these...

I see this as a result of communication between and a lack of teaching resources on this area.

???
What we see is that had we asked a question about the CDE and use appropiate methods, we would see that smoking cessation prevents dementia risk.
Had we asked a question about the total effect, smoking cessation increases your risk of dementia, but again this is not bias, but rather the unbiased result for a question that does not satisfy our interest.

???
Introducing different estimands for competing events has helped me demonstrate that when we prioritize the research question and let it guide the methods, the inverse association between cancer and dementia disappears. 
Recent work by Dr. Gina Nam, outstanding PhD candidates from the epi department, replicated this analysis on a much larger and diverse sample using code that I had written, showing similar results, further breaking this pattern in the literature.

## Effect of Incident Stroke on Dementia Risk Over 10 Years in a Cohort of Asian American and Non-Latino White Older Adults in California

.small[

???
Stroke can precipitate pathological changes in the neurovascular unitleading to loss of structural and functional connectivity that could increase dementia risk.
Previous work had major methodological limitations, including how to account for the fact that stroke increases mortality, which competes with dementia.
Studies on this topic have very selected samples with minimal (if any)representation of the Asian American population.

---

## Motivation

- Stroke can trigger pathological changes in the neurovascular unit, disrupting structural and functional connectivity and increasing dementia risk

--

- Existing studies have highly selected samples with little to no representation of Asian Americans

--

- Prior research has major methodological limitations

---
## Research question

- .bigger[What is the direct effect of incident stroke in the 10-year-risk of dementia across different Asian American ethnicities and White populations, had we eliminated death?]

### Total effect of stroke on dementia risk

.center[&lt;img src=./figs/stroke_rd_total.png width="90%"/&gt;]

???
However, if we would have targeted a total effect, including the indirect path that stroke increases mortality, all effects shift towards or below the null. This reiterates how different ways to account for death as a competing event can lead to very different results. 

Now on all analysis, we are assuming that there is no measurement error, but we can expect that those who have had a stroke had a strick screening of cognitive impairment. And  among those who don't have stroke, their is potential underdiagnosis of dementia. To understand how this bias could impact our results we did a QBA.
