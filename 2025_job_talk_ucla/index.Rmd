I was born and raised in Bolivia, where I earned my medical degree. This map, from The Lancet Global Health, shows healthcare access and quality worlwide, andh illustrates that Bolivia is one of the most disadvantaged countries in South America in regards to heath acces. Experiencing these health inequities during my training fueled my passion for research, though educational opportunities were also scarce.

I moved to Argentia, where I earned a Master’s in Clinical Research and completed a two-year graduate program in statistics for health sciences. I was a research fellow in the Internal Medicine Department, and transitioned to  research associate in a liver transplant unit, leading a project on longitudinal data collection for transplant candidates.
Working with EHR data exposed me to the challenges of leveraging such complex and powerful data to answer meaningful research questions. I was determined to learn causal inference methods as a next step.

I completed a PhD in Epidemiology at Eramus MC in the Netherlands, shifting to dementia research. As you can see in this map, healthcare access is highly ranked in the region. So when I realized that I had gone too far on methods and clinical research when my passion began from living inequities in my country, I chose to find a postdoc that could help me bridge causal inference methods with social epidemiology. So I feel very lucky to be a postdoc at UCLA in this Department.

For instance, several studies suggest that hypertension at older ages might reduce dementia risk, and refer to biological mechanisms to support this claim. In a recent project from my group, we showcase that indeed hazard ratios for this relationship shift toward the null at older ages.

However, When we look at absolute risk differences, we observed a different story: individuals with hypertension have a higher cumulative incidence of dementia over time, with differences growing substantially at older ages.

???
Stroke can precipitate pathological changes in the neurovascular unitleading to loss of structural and functional connectivity that could increase dementia risk.
Previous work had major methodological limitations, including how to account for the fact that stroke increases mortality, which competes with dementia.
Studies on this topic have very selected samples with minimal (if any)representation of the Asian American population.
