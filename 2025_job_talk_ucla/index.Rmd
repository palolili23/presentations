I was born and raised in Bolivia, where I earned my medical degree. This map, from The Lancet Global Health, shows healthcare access and quality worlwide, shows that Bolivia (located here) is one of the most disadvantaged countries in South America in heath access and quality. Experiencing these health inequities during my training fueled my passion for research, though educational opportunities were also scarce.

I moved to Argentia, where I earned a Master’s in Clinical Research and completed a two-year graduate program in statistics for health sciences. I was a research fellow in the Internal Medicine Department, and transitioned to  research associate in a liver transplant unit, leading a project on longitudinal data collection for transplant candidates. During this time I became instructor for biostatistics in a master program, and founded R-Ladies Buenos Aires, a chapter to teach programing to women and gender minorities.
Working with EHR data exposed me to the challenges of leveraging such complex and powerful data to answer meaningful research questions. I was determined to learn causal inference methods as a next step.

I completed a PhD in Epidemiology at Erasmus MC in Rotterdam Netherlands, my work was to extend causal inference methods in dementia research. During my PhD, I visited the CAUSALab at Harvard, TA’d an online course on Confounding by Dr. Miguel Hernán. I also spent time in Bremen, Germany at the Leibniz Institute. These experiences helped me build strong collaborations with causal inference experts such as Vanessa Didelez. However, by the end of my PhD I realized that I had drifted from my passion, understanding health inequities, and I seeked a postdoc to learn about the field of social epi.

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a global public health issue, disproportionately affecting women and underserved populations, including those in LMICs. Despite the growing burden, there is limited understanding of the underlying causes and little success in developing effective therapies.
So there is a big interest on identifying modifiable risk factors that could prevent the risk of dementia

However, very frequently researchers how found unexpected inverse associtions between common risks factors, such as smoking, hypertension, and obesity, and dementia, and extended seeking to explore the biological mechanisms that explain these differences. A more extreme case is the vast literature on the inverse association between cancer & dementia.

Now your epi radar might be thinking, this is obviously survival bias, but through my talk I will illustrate that bias is not necessarely bias, but rather the unbiased answer to the wrong estimand

For instance, several studies suggest that hypertension at older ages might reduce dementia risk, and refer to biological mechanisms to support this claim. In a recent project from my group, we showcase that indeed hazard ratios for this relationship shift toward the null at older ages.

However, When we look at absolute risk differences, we observed a different story: individuals with hypertension have a higher cumulative incidence of dementia over time, with differences growing substantially at older ages.

Stroke can precipitate pathological changes in the neurovascular unitleading to loss of structural and functional connectivity that could increase dementia risk.
Previous work had major methodological limitations, including how to account for the fact that stroke increases mortality, which competes with dementia.
Studies on this topic have very selected samples with minimal (if any)representation of the Asian American population.

However, if we would have targeted a total effect, including the indirect path that stroke increases mortality, all effects shift towards or below the null. This reiterates how different ways to account for death as a competing event can lead to very different results. 

Now on all analysis, we are assuming that there is no measurement error, but we can expect that those who have had a stroke had a strick screening of cognitive impairment. And  among those who don't have stroke, their is potential underdiagnosis of dementia. To understand how this bias could impact our results we did a QBA.

### Quantitative bias analysis for differential dementia diagnosis

We set the sensitivity of dementia diagnosis in the stroke arm to 0.99 and considered a range of sensitivity values in the no-stroke arm, from 0.50 (worst case scenario) to 0.90.

???
As we observed in the paper in MESA, under the same intervention we would need to intervene on more Latinx and Black particulants, as they have a larger burden of disease. 
As opossed to an randomized trial where the interventions are assigned randomly to create balanced groups, effect heterogeneity in observational studies can arise from multiple sources, such as a differential frequency of the exposure, difference in outcome and in competing events. Different groups may have a different confounding structure.
