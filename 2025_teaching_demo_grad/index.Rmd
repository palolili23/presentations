## Learning goals

1. Understand the consistency assumption in ideal conditions

2. Identify challenges to the consistency assumption in complex settings

3. Propose strategies to address violations by refining research questions

## Recap: Identifiability Assumptions

To answer causal questions with real data we need three conditions:

- Exchangeability

--

- Consistency

--

- Positivity

- **.green[Consistency]**

## Consistency assumption

For a person who was **.purple[actually treated]** $Y_{i}^{A=1}$ <br> 
--
their **.green[counterfactual outcome had they been treated]** $Y_{i}^{a=1}$ <br>
--
is exactly their **observed outcome** $Y_i$.

For a person who was **.purple[actually untreated]** $Y_{i}^{A=0}$ <br>
their **.green[counterfactual outcome had they been untreated]** $Y_{i}^{a=0}$ <br>
is exactly their **observed outcome** $Y_i$] 

--

In summary: $A_{i} = a$, then $Y_{i}^{a} = Y_{i}^{A} = Y_{i}$

---
## Well-defined interventions

- Everyone receiving the same level of exposure is actually receiving it in the same way, without differences in how it is delivered.

--

- There are no multiple versions of the treatment.

--

- This assumption can be satisfied by designed in randomized trials (e.g., vaccination, medications ) 

---
## Exercise: Well-defined intervention


--

- In this cohort study, they asked about chocolate consumption using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).

--

- Discuss with your colleague to your right (or behind): How could the definition of chocolate consumption be improved to ensure a well-defined intervention?

## No Interference

We assume that the outcome (technically all **potential** outcomes, regardless of whether they are observed) for any subject does not depend on another subject's exposure. 

--

For e.g. imagine a trial to see wether white noise improves concentration compared to classical music, using spotify in a school. But even if the intervention is randomized, people might be influenced on what their peers listen. 


---

## Real-world complex scenarios

- When an RCT is feasible, the consistency assumption is most likely satisfied (E.g., vaccines, medications)

--

- In observational studies it is tricky if we only have measured a proxy of the intervention of interest

  - Systolic blood pressure
  - History of diabetes
  - Loneliness scale
  - Race
  
---
## Exercise: real-world scenarios

A researcher is interested in the causal effect of **systolic blood pressure** on the **risk of dementia**.

Discuss with your colleague to your right (or behind):
  + Is this a well-defined intervention? 
  + Propose a more precise question (perhaps only describing one version of A), describe the treatment strategies for a (hypothetical) randomized trial to study the effect.


```{r}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 3, seconds = 0, bottom = 0)

## Exercise: real-world scenarios

A researcher is interested in the causal effect of **residencial segregation** on **preeclampsia**.

Discuss with your colleague to your right (or behind):
  + Is this a well-defined intervention? 
  + Propose a more precise question (perhaps only describing one version of A), describe the treatment strategies for a (hypothetical) randomized trial to study the effect.
